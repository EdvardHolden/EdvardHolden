### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

PhD Computer Science - the University of Manchester

Researching the intersection of machine learning and automated reasoning.

Developer of:
- [HOS-ML](https://gitlab.com/edvardholden/hos-ml): heterogeneous instance optimisation and effective heuristic [SCPeduling](https://gitlab.com/edvardholden/scpeduler).
- [Axiom Captioning](https://github.com/EdvardHolden/axiom_caption): Premise selection with language models via transfer learning on graph neural networks.


I am currently open to new projects in machine learning and data science, and I am open to connecting on LinkedIn
